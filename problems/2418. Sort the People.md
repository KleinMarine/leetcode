# 2418. Sort the People #

## Problem
https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-the-people/

## Problem Description
You are given an array of strings `names`, and an array `heights` that consists of distinct **positive** integers. Both arrays are of length `n`.

For each index `i`, `names[i]` and `heights[i]` denote the name and height of the i<sup>th</sup> person.

Return `names` sorted in **descending** order by the people's heights.

### Example 1:
**Input:** names = ["Mary","John","Emma"], heights = [180,165,170]  

**Output:** ["Mary","Emma","John"]  

**Explanation:** Mary is the tallest, followed by Emma and John.  

### Example 2:
**Input:** names = ["Alice","Bob","Bob"], heights = [155,185,150]  

**Output:** ["Bob","Alice","Bob"]  

**Explanation:** The first Bob is the tallest, followed by Alice and the second Bob.  

### Constraints:  
* `n == names.length == heights.length`
* `1 <= n <= 10<sup>3</sup>`
* `1 <= names[i].length <= 20`
* `1 <= heights[i] <= 10<sup>5</sup>`
* `names[i]` consists of lower and upper case English letters.
* All the values of `heights` are distinct.

## Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> sortPeople(vector<string>& names, vector<int>& heights) {
        for (int i = 0; i < heights.size()-1; i++){
            for (int j = 0; j < heights.size()-i-1; j++){
                if (heights[j] < heights[j+1]){
                    swap(heights[j], heights[j+1]);
                    swap(names[j], names[j+1]);
                }
            }
        }
        return names;
    }
};

```
