# 1518. Water Bottles #

## Problem

https://leetcode.com/problems/water-bottles/  

## Problem Description

There are `numBottles` water bottles that are initially full of water. You can exchange `numExchange` empty water bottles from the market with one full water bottle.

The operation of drinking a full water bottle turns it into an empty bottle.

Given the two integers `numBottles` and `numExchange`, return the **maximum** number of water bottles you can drink.

 
### Example 1:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84a19669-9017-4afb-a7c6-ffa1fe9d3988)

**Input:** numBottles = 9, numExchange = 3  

**Output:** 13  

**Explanation:** You can exchange 3 empty bottles to get 1 full water bottle.  

Number of water bottles you can drink: 9 + 3 + 1 = 13.  
### Example 2:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4930306f-7768-4bb8-bda1-7e04979fcc6d)

**Input:** numBottles = 15, numExchange = 4  

**Output:** 19  

**Explanation:** You can exchange 4 empty bottles to get 1 full water bottle.   

Number of water bottles you can drink: 15 + 3 + 1 = 19.  

### Constraints:  

* `1 <= numBottles <= 100`
* `2 <= numExchange <= 100`

## Code
```cpp
class Solution {
private:
    void drink(int& fullWater, int& emptyWater, int& bottles){
        emptyWater += fullWater;
        bottles += fullWater;
        fullWater = 0;
    }

    void exchange(int& fullWater, int& emptyWater, int numExchange){
        int remainBottles = emptyWater % numExchange;
        fullWater = (emptyWater-remainBottles) / numExchange;
        emptyWater = remainBottles;
    }

public:
    int numWaterBottles(int numBottles, int numExchange) {
        int fullWater = numBottles;
        int emptyWater = 0;
        int bottles = 0;

        while((fullWater + emptyWater) >= numExchange || fullWater != 0){
            drink(fullWater, emptyWater, bottles);
            exchange(fullWater, emptyWater, numExchange);
        }

        return bottles;
    }
};

```
